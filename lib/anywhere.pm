package anywhere;

# ABSTRACT: Use a module (or feature) everywhere

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  #!/usr/bin/perl

  use strict;
  use anywhere qw/ feature say /;
  use Greet;

  Greet::hello();

  # in Greet.pm
  package Greet;
  use strict;
  sub hello {
    say "Helloooooo!!!!";
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<anywhere> is a fork of L<everywhere> 0.07 while waiting my proposed change to
be merged (if ever). It currently only has one difference compared to
C<everywhere>: it sets C<%INC> entry to the file path instead of letting Perl
set it to C<CODE(0x...)> so other modules see the used module more normally and
C<anywhere> can work with things like L<true>.

The rest is from L<everywhere> documentation:

I got tired of putting "use 5.010" at the top of every module. So now I can
throw this in my toplevel program and not have to Repeat Myself elsewhere.

In theory you should be able to pass it whatever you pass to use.

Also, I just made it so you can do:

  use anywhere 'MooseX::Declare',
    matching => '^MyApp',
    use_here => 0;

for example and then it will only apply this module to things matching your
regex. And not use it here. You can also throw in 'package_level => 1' to use
your package after every "package ..." line. All these are experimental :)
